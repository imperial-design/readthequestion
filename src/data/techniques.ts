    parentExplanation:
      'Test anxiety impairs working memory and executive function — the very cognitive resources children need most in exams. A controlled trial with Primary 5 students (Khng, 2017) found that deep breathing before a maths test significantly reduced anxiety and improved performance. Breathing activates the parasympathetic nervous system, reducing cortisol and restoring cognitive capacity. Some researchers (Beilock) also find that briefly writing down worries before a test frees up working memory.',

      'Always read the question TWO times before looking at the answers. Cover the answers first — no peeking! This stops you getting tricked.',
    parentExplanation:
      'Nearly a third of all errors in 11+ exams come from misreading, not from lack of knowledge. The "read twice" habit forces metacognitive engagement — children must process the question on two levels (comprehension, then analysis) before seeing any answer options. This eliminates the most common source of avoidable marks lost.',

    researchSource: 'NFER Analysis of 11+ Performance',

    parentExplanation:
      'Process of elimination transforms guessing from a 25% chance (1 in 4) to at least 50% (1 in 2) when even one option is eliminated. More importantly, it forces systematic evaluation of every option rather than impulsive selection of the first plausible answer — a cognitive bias called "satisficing" that costs children significant marks. Test-taking research also shows that answers containing absolute qualifiers (always, never, all, none) are more frequently incorrect, giving children a concrete starting heuristic.',

    parentExplanation:
      'The "two-pass strategy" — answering easy questions first, then returning to difficult ones — maximises marks per minute. Research on timed assessments shows that students who spend disproportionate time on a single difficult question frequently run out of time and miss easy marks later. Training children to recognise when to move on is as important as teaching them how to answer.',

    whyItMatters:

    parentExplanation:
      'Research consistently shows that answer-checking catches approximately 1 in 5 errors. Contrary to the popular "first instinct fallacy", Bauer et al. (2007) analysed real exam answer sheets and found changes were "predominantly from wrong to right". Critically, students who were informed about this tendency were more likely to check and change — and scored higher.

Crucially, students who were informed about this research were more likely to review and change answers — and they scored higher.
